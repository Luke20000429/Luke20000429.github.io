My name is Xueshen Liu (刘学深). I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering Division at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Z. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/). My research interests focus on building systems bridging the gap between software and hardware. I am currently working on accelerating large language models (LLMs) through efficient system-algorithm co-design. 

### Education:

- **University of Michigan** (2022 - )   
  Ph.D of Computer Science & Engineering
- **University of Michigan** (2020 - 2022)   
  Bachelor of Computer Science 
- **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** (2018 - 2022)   
  Bachelor of Electric & Computer Engineering 

### Projects:
- [**Low-cost MoE Training**](https://github.com/Luke20000429/MoE-Training):      
    On-going project to reduce the cost of training MoE models by 50%.
- [**Computation-awared KV Cache (CAKE) Loader**](https://github.com/Luke20000429/CAKE-stream):    
    CAKE is a novel KV cache loader that reduces LLM prefill latency on long-context through a bidirectional KV cache generation strategy overlapping computation and I/O transfer.
- [**Learn To be Efficienct (LTE)**](https://github.com/haizhongzheng/LTE):     
    Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE) trains LLMs to activate fewer neurons while maintaining performance through structured sparsity, achieving linear speedup with our custom CUDA kernel.
- [**Minimap2-gigabase**](https://github.com/Minimap2onGPU/minimap2.git):      
    Minimap2-gigabase (mm2-gb) is based on minimap2-v2.24 with GPU accelerated chaining kernel for high throughput accurate mapping of ultra-long reads.
- [**IMAGician**](https://github.com/gty929/IMAGician):      
    IMAGician is an Android App based on Image Steganography Technology. It embeds invisible watermarks in images to protect copyright of creators. Check our [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsU-6BkyvHQ) on Youtube.
